# What a great news !

We are updating the website and this is such a great thing for us.

I’m new at Hugo, and I’m in the mid of porting all my site from wordpress to Hugo.
Is there any ways to limit the words of summaries ?

As the default is first 70 words, how if I want to make it less than that ?
The problem I faced right now is I the content from wordpress more tag is more than 70 words.


## Introduction.

We are now cool people. Many Thanks to you !
